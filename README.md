# transfer-learning_VGG
Among many other robust architectures, the VGG-16 CNN is one of the champions of its time. This work will explore applying transfer learning and retraining a classification of road traffic signs, based on pre-trained weights from ImageNet competition. The new model was able to train 43 classes, despite its performance being underrated compared to the literature.
